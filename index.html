    <p class="p1">My goals for the first course in the Computing Applications degree at Texas Tech are to master foundational concepts in computing 
      applications and become familiar with theories, technologies, and professional environments.
      I plan to gain a deeper understanding in digital tools and problem-solving. Improving my project management skills is also a motivator for taking this course. 
      <span class="indent"> Earning a Computing Applications degree places me one step closer to a master's degree in cyber systems and operations or computer science!
      My educational goals directly tie in to the plans I have set for myself career-wise as a sailor.</span>

    <section class="autoShow"><p class="p2">My future in the Navy includes a direct path to commissioning after I complete a Bachelor's degree. 
    With my tactical skills currently in development on active duty, I am working towards successful completion of a 
    Bachelor of Science degree in order to meet the immediate selection requirements for the officer program I am interested in.
    <span class="indent">Having completed the Officer Aptitude Rating with the desired score, receiving excellent physical readiness scores for three
    consecutive cycles, and tackling a STEM degree directly related to science and technology, I am on track to reach my goal.</span>
    I will be responsible for conducting computer network operations and overseeing the work of sailors in my current position.
    I plan on making a career out of my naval service and treading paths I never thought I'd take.</p></section>
