# *TOOL: PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT*


## Project Name: *Kierstin Russell's First Website*


## Project Purpose

This project will increase my familiarity with building a well-structured, single-page website using fundamental, semantic HTML tags.


## Description

The webpage will provide me with an opportunity to share my education and career goals, highlight my hobbies, and include required tags such as:

* html
* head
* title
* body
* h1,h2
* p
* ul
* li
* a


## Desired Results

The webpage renders correctly and includes all nine required HTML elements. The layout is clear and simple to follow, and my image populates in a browser.


## Exclusions

Since this project focuses on building the structural foundation of a semantic HTML webpage, the webpage will initially be void of CSS visual design and JavaScript features.


## Priorities

1. Clean code
2. Required Content
3. Functional Layout


## Acceptance Criteria

Professor Greg Gamel will sign off on the project on 31AUG25 and no later than 06SEP25 when the HTML page includes:

* successful implementation of requested HTML element tags
* correct rendering in a browser
* a title element in the head and a main heading with my name
* a subheading for my major or professional interests
* two paragraphs describing my goals for the course or my career
* an unordered list no less than 3 items detailing my hobbies
* a hyperlink to my GitHub profile
