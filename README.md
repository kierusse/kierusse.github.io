# My First Website
#### This is the first website created by myself, Kierstin Russell, for the purpose of learning HTML and CSS, officially launched in September 2025. It will become a hub for my personal and professional portfolio, and continue to serve as an opportunity to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS as well as enhanced languages in the future. The website theme is inspired by 1980s retro synthwave, Tron, and Back to the Future color palettes. I plan to experiment with features showcasing my hobbies and look forward to developing my coding skills!
